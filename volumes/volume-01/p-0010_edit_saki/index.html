        <p>The afternoon after a memorable first day of high school, I sat across from my childhood friend Aika in Café Adolescentza, staring into a cup of coffee I couldn&rsquo;t drink.</p>
<p>Pretty stylish for a student, having lunch at an atmospheric private café—except that it&rsquo;s my house. Mom runs the place as a hobby, and her signature coffee blend has a fanbase, but she&rsquo;ll close up and vanish on a whim if the mood strikes her.</p>
<p>And so, the &ldquo;Closed&rdquo; sign hung on the door, with just the two of us inside.</p>
<p>And even the aggressive smell of curry wafting from Aika&rsquo;s plate couldn&rsquo;t penetrate the fog of my current crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Why the hell did I write something like that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aika shoveled down another bite of curry. &ldquo;Mm. &lsquo;Twintail Club&rsquo; is pretty ridiculous, yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was panicking! It was unconscious, I swear I didn&rsquo;t mean to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that it came out unconsciously, like it&rsquo;s burned into your brain at that level—that&rsquo;s what I think is more worrying. Your twintail obsession, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up! Everyone makes unexpected mistakes once or twice in their life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure, fufufu.&rdquo; She pinched each of her waist-length twintails &amp; sent them swaying in the direction of my sideways gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Ngh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably meant as provocation, but to me, it felt more like a handshake—refreshing, even.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re magnificent twintails, as always.</p>
<p>The most basic style—perfectly symmetrical, flowing to her waist. Elementary, yeah, but you can feel the noble pride of someone who&rsquo;s spent years perfecting it. Like how a master&rsquo;s painting captivates without flashiness or ornamentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, the teacher didn&rsquo;t have to say it <em>out loud</em>&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was bizarre enough to make her blurt it out, <em>what&rsquo;d you expect?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pointless argument wasn&rsquo;t changing anything. I&rsquo;d committed one of the biggest blunders of my life on day one of high school. No taking it back now.</p>
<hr>
<p>My school, Yougetsu Academy, is one of those super-escalator places—elementary through university, all in one.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think advancing to the high school division would particularly move me, but the building, the gymnasium &hellip; everything was on a <em>completely</em> different scale from middle school. Completely overwhelming.</p>
<p>The club-led orientation after the entrance ceremony was spectacular too. Sports clubs and cultural clubs took turns performing to appeal to new students, each a one-minute showcase packed with passion.</p>
<p>But all that really burned itself into my brain was the girl who took the stage afterward.</p>
<p>Or more precisely, her hairstyle.</p>
<p><em>Twintails</em>.</p>
<p>Shindou Erina.</p>
<p>She was <em>tiny</em>—elementary-school-sized—but when she spoke, her voice carried the weight of historical conquerors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all have infinite potential. I—and Yougetsu Academy&rsquo;s high school division—promise to be the guidepost that helps your brilliant futures blossom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Words that could&rsquo;ve sounded arrogant from anyone else. From her? Pure charisma. Even just standing there, she radiated elegant dignity.</p>
<p>(Beautiful&hellip;)</p>
<p>I forgot to blink.</p>
<p>Ojou-sama speech like you&rsquo;d never expect to hear in-person, flowing naturally from a girl for the first time. It made her charm hit all the harder.</p>
<p>And the <em>twintails!</em></p>
<p>Hair has no class, obviously, but if I had to describe them—<em>noble</em>. Graceful. The curled tips gave off an air of good breeding. As she gestured, more animated with each passionate word, her twintails danced with her. Like a princess and her partner, waltzing under the chandeliers.</p>
<p>My heart hammered. Everyone around me seemed to be looking at her like she was an adorable kitten. Probably just my imagination. They didn&rsquo;t get it. A school where someone with twintails like <strong>THAT</strong> is student council president—the next three years were going to be <em>incredible</em>.</p>
<p>On the way back to class, my classmates swapped impressions of the orientation. I stayed lost in that dazzling image. The orientation&rsquo;s moving afterglow? Forget about it, completely overshadowed.</p>
<p>Yeah, after seeing something that amazing, my head was full of twintails. Of <em>course</em> I spaced out during self-introductions back in the classroom. I didn&rsquo;t even notice when they handed out the club preference survey&hellip;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Alright then, please collect them from the back~&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;huh?&rdquo; The homeroom teacher&rsquo;s drawn-out voice snapped me back.</p>
<p>A girl whose name I didn&rsquo;t know (<em>naturally—I hadn&rsquo;t been listening</em>) passed me the sheets from behind. Suddenly, I panicked. <em>Oh no</em>. My eyes flashed down to the blank sheet, and, scrambling under pressure from the paper-pusher, I scrawled across it the <em>first thing</em> that came to mind.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; oh my~ there&rsquo;s one without a name written~&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, God. &ldquo;Ah&hellip; sorry, that&rsquo;s probably mine, I was in a rush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher tilted her head and double-checked the collected sheets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh~ so it <em>was</em> Mitsuka-kun.&rdquo; A lengthy pause. &ldquo;<em>Twintail Club?</em>&rdquo; A round of snickers rose as fast as the hairs on my back. &ldquo;Was there such a thing as a Twintail Club? Or, this is a request to <em>establish</em> a <em>new</em> one~?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What?!</em> <em>No</em>, I don&rsquo;t want to <em>start</em> a club, I just—!&rdquo; Staring eyes &amp; panic alike killed the words in my throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see~ Twintail Club, huh~. So <em>Mitsuka-kun</em> likes <em>twintails</em>~&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;—Ah, yes, absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah. Conditioned reflex.</p>
<p>Slow, quiet dread crept in over the next few silent seconds.</p>
<p>&hellip;I&rsquo;d been thinking this was a fresh start with all-new faces &hellip; but that was the moment my position for the rest of high school was locked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Well!</em> Alright, everyone, we&rsquo;ll end homeroom now, but apparently there have been more <em>perverts</em> around this area lately, so <em>please be careful—♪</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nearly fell out of my chair as the laughter picked up. &ldquo;<em>Why are you saying that <strong>NOW</strong> of all times?!</em> Hey, Sensei, wait! <em>I&rsquo;m serious!</em> I <em>seriously</em> love twintails!! Ah &hellip; no, wait, I mean—!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuhhhhhhh&hellip;</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just <em>remembering</em> it drained the life from my body.</p>
<p>Seeing a blank space and instantly writing &ldquo;twintail&rdquo;—what an insane reflex. Beyond physiological response. Biological instinct territory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mfh, mph &hellip; mm. Seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t get a single cup of coffee down, and Aika was already working on her second plate of curry. Or, well, I&rsquo;m not hungry anyways, but that was technically <em>my</em> plate, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Aika&rsquo;s chewing slowed. &ldquo;More than writing it by mistake, your follow-up was the real problem. You panicked <em>way</em> too hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could tell I was panicking, YOU should&rsquo;ve helped me out! We&rsquo;re friends, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;friends &hellip; yeah, right.&rdquo; Aika pouted, lowering her head to my stolen curry plate.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s with you, stealing my lunch like that?</p>
<p>Her gaze came up again. &ldquo;That survey was just for first impressions, Souji. A preliminary preference check. There was a note saying &lsquo;if there&rsquo;s a club you&rsquo;d like to create yourself, please write it here,&rsquo; but that&rsquo;s just formality, right? <em>What student would actually assert themselves like that right off the bat?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh &hellip; well&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>In other words</em>, requesting a new club there is like <em>loudly declaring</em> that even after the handbook and <em>all</em> those presentations, you&rsquo;re <em>completely</em> unwavering—you&rsquo;ve <em>already decided</em>. <em>This</em> is what you want to do. <em>This</em> is the club you want to create. <em>Riiight?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;and I wrote &lsquo;Twintail Club.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was almost a smug look she gave me. &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can analyze it calmly NOW, but back then my mind was completely blank!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I can say <em>with confidence</em> that I wouldn&rsquo;t <em>blurt out the name of a hairstyle most people don&rsquo;t even know the word for.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> any persuasive power when you— <strong>NGH!</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>My modest resistance, cut short. See, her chest is touchy territory—easy argument material—but as you can see &hellip; she punches guys in the face mid-meal.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t help it. Everything else about her is perfect. Especially her twintails. And also, her twintails. Did I mention those?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow. If only I had better improv skills&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The president&rsquo;s speech promised brilliant futures. But mine? Indirectly <em>closed off</em> because of her. But like Aika said, I guess my own incompetence did this.</p>
<p>I held my head in my hands, radiating depression.</p>
<p>Aika poked my arm in the side. &ldquo;You know your twintail obsession would&rsquo;ve been exposed sooner or later anyway. Isn&rsquo;t it better to get it over with early? Think positive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <em>that&rsquo;s</em> why you&rsquo;re casually polishing off both our portions while I&rsquo;m at life&rsquo;s crossroads! How can you eat curry while drinking coffee, anyways?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A big eater who&rsquo;s demolished two plates of curry in minutes, and she&rsquo;s still stuck with a chest like that. Could it be all the nutrients go to maintaining that hair?</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>A strange chill hit me. I glanced toward the back of the shop. &ldquo;&hellip;huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman sat in a corner seat, positioned at a right angle from us.</p>
<p>Was she glancing our way? That&rsquo;s weird. Mom should&rsquo;ve closed up.</p>
<p>But the cup on her table meant she&rsquo;d been here from the start—we just hadn&rsquo;t noticed &hellip; somehow. Mom probably left in a hurry without checking. Great. We made all that noise, thinking no one was here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Souji&hellip; you&rsquo;re doing it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d unconsciously pinched Aika&rsquo;s twintail between my fingers.</p>
<p>She sighed. I hurriedly let go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a habit since we were kids. Aika&rsquo;s <em>also</em> at fault for leaving her twintails on the table where they&rsquo;re easy to touch, though—but saying that would be pretty selfish. When they&rsquo;re that long, she has to rest them somewhere or they&rsquo;d drag on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. You know it calms me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She sighed again. &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;m probably going to have a hard time because of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stumbled. &ldquo;I-if people get the wrong idea, how are you gonna take responsibility? Eventually everyone&rsquo;s gonna figure out what &lsquo;<em>twintails</em>&rsquo; means &hellip; and then, me being friends with you will be &hellip; that kind of &hellip; <em>misunderstanding</em>&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slowly drained her coffee through her straw, alternating her gaze between me and the table, fingers poking together bashfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, so you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;ll change your hairstyle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>N-no way!</em> Why should I change my hairstyle just because someone says something? I <em>like</em> it this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haha, that&rsquo;s my girl. That unwavering conviction—I&rsquo;m proud of it as her childhood friend.</p>
<p>She complains, but Aika&rsquo;s my greatest ally when it comes to twintails. True, we&rsquo;re always together, so people tease us a lot. But we don&rsquo;t need to worry about what others say.</p>
<p>Childhood friends. Best friends.</p>
<p>Everyone has one or two friends like that, right? The kind you know you&rsquo;ll be close with for life, can talk to freely. Mine just &hellip; happens to be the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Our houses are next door, but apparently our families have been close since before we were born. We&rsquo;re basically siblings. Family.</p>
<p>When I found out the reason I kept losing fights to her was because her martial artist grandpa was training her, my competitive spirit drove me to join the dojo too. That was probably the turning point. We spent even more time together after that. We&rsquo;d just started elementary school back then.</p>
<p>For some reason, we kept ending up in the same class. Even in high school, where most faces are new from outside transfers, we&rsquo;re naturally together. It goes way beyond &ldquo;inseparable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aika was popular with everyone—boys and girls—thanks to her friendly personality, her strength, her refreshingly energetic vibe.</p>
<p>Nothing like me, screwing up on day one. I really need to make sure not to cause her more trouble.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;—!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cold chill hit me—stronger than before.</p>
<p>Aika tilted her head. &ldquo;Hm? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. &ldquo;No way, how &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t sense any <em>presence</em>&hellip;?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;wait, do you normally go through life sensing people&rsquo;s presence?</p>
<p>In the back, that woman glanced our way again. When our eyes met, she spun her chair around and stared at the wall.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but mutter. &ldquo;&hellip;what the&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weird. But customers get annoyed when people are loud, I guess. Let&rsquo;s keep it down.</p>
<p>I stopped paying attention, but Aika couldn&rsquo;t—I could tell from her twintails. Stiff, alert. They carry emotions just like faces do. Anger, sadness, joy, distrust, tension.</p>
<p>&hellip; well, that&rsquo;s my philosophy, anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Mm.&rdquo; Aika gestured subtly to guide my gaze.</p>
<p>The woman had spread a newspaper like a screen, with a finger-poked hole showing one round eye.</p>
<p>Huh? Showa era comedy routine. So cliché I could spit sand. Was this a skit being filmed? I suspected hidden cameras. God, I don&rsquo;t wanna get caught as Random Citizen A.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Let&rsquo;s just stop making eye contact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Aika seemed to agree—not engaging, but staying on guard.</p>
<p>But just then, the woman folded her newspaper &amp; stood up. Leaving? Finally, a moment of relief—</p>
<p>Then she walked <em>straight toward us</em> instead of to the exit.</p>
<p>We tensed. She stopped right next to our table, and smiled cheerfully at me—<em>only</em> me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;may I join you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait <em>wait WAIT!!</em>&rdquo; The tension of the comedy routine-in-progress abruptly snapped as Aika leapt up &amp; broke into a defensive growl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; The woman tilted her head, unfazed by Aika&rsquo;s glare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who <strong>ARE</strong> you!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>I DO mind!</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have business with this young man.&rdquo; Like a tour guide, she indicated me with an elegantly tilted palm—which I immediately lurched away from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>With</em> <em><strong>ME!?</strong></em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s <strong>MY</strong> friend, what&rsquo;re you <em>thinking?!</em> Acting all meek while wearing clothes that show off your <em>boobs</em>—it&rsquo;s <em>pissing</em> me off! <em>I&rsquo;ll jam a straw in your cleavage!!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, I found my hands pulling my friend back from the intruder. &ldquo;Whoa, whoa, calm down, Aika! Seriously.&rdquo; But my eyes kept drifting to the girl.</p>
<p>Her odd assertion had been distracting, but up close &hellip; she was an <em>incredible</em> beauty. The definition of bishoujo.</p>
<p>Fluent Japanese, but clearly foreign. Silver hair, but not the unnatural dyed look; a near-pure surreal silver that seemed to defy flesh. Even in the café&rsquo;s dim light, it let off an iridescent pearl glow.</p>
<p>Long lashes, beaming sapphire-clear blue eyes. Straight nose, and small pink lips curled into a smile.</p>
<p>Like a fairy from the movies. I could almost see the motes of light surrounding her &hellip; and if I lowered my gaze even slightly—an overwhelmingly <em>voluminous</em> chest demanding attention.</p>
<p>What an outrageous fairy.</p>
<p>Same age as Aika, probably? The difference was <em>painfully</em> clear.</p>
<p>Well, she had neat features, but just thin clothing emphasizing cleavage. Over that, what <em>looked</em> like a lab coat—or perhaps a stylish coat-lab coat hybrid. The skirt beneath couldn&rsquo;t even qualify as a mini, as dangerously short as it was. I was surprised I couldn&rsquo;t see her underwear. But seeing those slender legs, I understood what I saw: A carefully coordinated outfit backed by <em>absolute confidence</em>. Definitely not someone you encounter in ordinary life.</p>
<p>Still, what a shame; that shimmering silver hair, I mean. Twintails would suit it perfectly.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, there&rsquo;s that again. Mentally editing twintails onto women I just met.</p>
<p>I bet most teenage guys just mentally <em>undress</em> cute girls. Me? I give them twintails. That&rsquo;s basically the same thing, right??</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow.&rdquo; Aika jabbed my temple with a straw. Must&rsquo;ve been staring too long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; She turned away.</p>
<p>Watching this, the silver-haired girl smirked. Not a soft smile—something sinister.</p>
<p>&hellip;or maybe it&rsquo;s my imagination? She has such a gentle vibe.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d try again. &ldquo;&hellip;um, do you need something from us&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl placed her hands on our bench and leaned in closer. I leaned back reflexively, and uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have <em>very</em> important business with <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;important business?&rdquo; Well, I can&rsquo;t pretend I didn&rsquo;t hear that.</p>
<p>Aika furrowed her brow harder—clearly annoyed at being deliberately shouldered out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Twirl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;I see. Twirl &hellip; san.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foreign name, then. Her Japanese is <em>really</em> fluent, though?</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s that sinister smile again. &ldquo;You like <em>twintails</em>, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love them.&rdquo; Wait, <em>dammit</em>. Affirmation without hesitation again. Haven&rsquo;t I learned <em>anything</em> from today??</p>
<p>She followed with a silky voice: &ldquo;Then would you put on this bracelet without asking <em>any</em> questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <em>completely</em> out of left field?!&rdquo; But she had already slipped something from her lab coat pocket—an incredibly beautiful, brilliantly glowing red bracelet—into my fingers with her own set over mine &hellip; like it was a wedding ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-wait a sec.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Graceful fingers traced the back of my hand. An indescribable ticklish sensation shot through my entire body. &ldquo;Come on, please put it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it back, Souji!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, Aika leaned across the table, snatched the bracelet, and roughly shoved it back into the woman&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your deal!? Suddenly hassling us, and doing this—it&rsquo;s <em>rude!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twirl burst out laughing. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m certainly not a suspicious person~!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—at this point, no matter <em>how</em> you try to justify it, you&rsquo;re <em>incredibly</em> suspicious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Um, well, uh &hellip; <em>Ah!</em>&rdquo; Twirl snapped out of her obvious rapid-fire thinking and clapped her hands. &ldquo;Souji-kun, it&rsquo;s <em>me, me, me!</em> We go <em>way back!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head in shock. &ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, me! Come on, it&rsquo;s <em>me</em>, Twirl! Actually, I&rsquo;m in a bit of trouble &hellip; so will you please put on this bracelet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned forward—emphasizing her cleavage with the same arms holding forward the bracelet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the hell does an &lsquo;it&rsquo;s me&rsquo; scam <strong>TO YOUR FACE?!</strong>&rdquo; Aika&rsquo;s hand snapped forward, delivering a terrifying slap to Twirl&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;<em>HGYAA!!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nearly leapt. &ldquo;Are you <em>INSANE?!</em> Don&rsquo;t seriously hit someone you just met! That made a really nasty sound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My shout was practically a scream. That wasn&rsquo;t a slap—it was a cheekbone strike, one of the <em>Mizukage-ryuu Jujutsu</em> techniques from Aika&rsquo;s late Grandpa. Contrary to standard fighting theory, it doesn&rsquo;t shake the brain much &hellip; but delivers the heaviest, sharpest pain possible. Almost a torture technique.</p>
<p>And a mere high school girl executed it perfectly. No wonder the old man wanted Aika as his successor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Souji, this lady&rsquo;s gotta be a scammer! Like those girls near the station who drag you into alleys for fortune-telling, With Mohawks in spiked shoulder pads waiting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I snorted. &ldquo;The first half <em>maybe</em>, but the second half is <em>ridiculous!</em>&rdquo; I mean, after all, if those thugs existed, they&rsquo;d already be here.</p>
<p>Twirl held her cheek, looking down. I paused, and worriedly glanced at her. &ldquo;A-are you okay? She sometimes doesn&rsquo;t know when to hold back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beautiful and foreign—it&rsquo;d be <em>terrible</em> if this became an international incident.</p>
<p>Aika looked anxious. &ldquo;Huh &hellip; I DID hold back. It shouldn&rsquo;t hurt that much&hellip;&rdquo; She sounded like it was just like a scraped knee. If she held back, what was that sound?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m f-fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t sound fine..?&rdquo; Trembling while holding her cheek—obviously not fine.</p>
<p>I reached out to help—and found Aika wrenching my wrist away, with Twirl&rsquo;s hand having made a failed thrust from to slip the bracelet onto me from a blind spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an act!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so desperate to put that thing on me?!&rdquo; This was genuinely creepy now. I took a step back, but mentally, I&rsquo;d rather be a hundred feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t charge you anything! Just put it on! <em>Just putting it on</em> is enough! Please put it on, I&rsquo;m in <em>trouble</em> if you don&rsquo;t! If you&rsquo;d like, I&rsquo;ll put it on for you!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hold up, girl, mind your phrasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Souji! If you put it on, they&rsquo;ll say you can&rsquo;t cancel, and charge you tons! Armed <em>buggies</em> full of Mohawks will come crashing through the entrance!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aika sure has a sense of danger &hellip; but her threat model seems a bit skewed.</p>
<p>Just then, Twirl pulled back, clasped her hands together, prayer-like, and stared intently at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you put it on, I&rsquo;ll do <em>anything</em> you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It caught me by surprise, and I instantly knew it was silly and wrong, but my eyes shot to Twirl&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;<em>anything?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found myself leaning forward. How much would it satisfy me to see that vivid silver hair transformed into twintails?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; you can do <em>anything</em> to me. Standard stuff or something a bit <em>special!</em>&rdquo; Twirl&rsquo;s face had suddenly flushed red, her breathing ragged. &ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;d <em>totally welcome</em> special things&hellip;! Haha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pulled back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say scary shit like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is bad. Cultural differences—are the barriers between our races really this <em>thick?</em> Same language, but there&rsquo;s zero communication!</p>
<p>Aika was still scowling on the sidelines. &ldquo;&hellip;I can pretty much <em>guess</em> what you&rsquo;re thinking, but it&rsquo;s pointless. If you tell this guy you&rsquo;ll do &lsquo;anything&rsquo;, he&rsquo;s <em>definitely</em> going to ask you to wear twintails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, <em>THAT?</em> Even though he&rsquo;s a boy?!&rdquo; Twirl suddenly grew flustered.</p>
<p>Well yeah. Duh.</p>
<p>Twirl waved her apprehensiveness away with an awkward half-smile. &ldquo;Oh come on &hellip; it&rsquo;s okay! Here, as a bit of a down payment, go ahead and grab both of these with both hands. You&rsquo;ll be <em>amazed</em> at how soft they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thrust out her chest—jiggling with the slightest movement—with a psychotic grin, leaving me nowhere safe to flee to before she could smush them against me.</p>
<p>It only lasted a second before she had been ripped away by a grip on her shoulder. &ldquo;Get away, you pervert! I&rsquo;ll go for your <em>cervical spine</em> in self-defense, <em>your cervical spine!!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is <em>not</em> what self-defense means!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down, Aika! Fine, fine, I get it!&rdquo; I had to settle this before Aika crossed the line. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it. She&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s free, so if I think of it like the tissues they pass out on the street, it&rsquo;s fine, right? She&rsquo;ll be satisfied if I take it, right? &hellip; it <strong>IS</strong> free, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her beaming smile captivated me again. You know, if she&rsquo;d just act normal, she&rsquo;d be such a beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! &lsquo;<em>Free</em>&rsquo; is how scams start!&rdquo; Aika inhaled sharply. &ldquo;They lure you in with &lsquo;<em>free admission</em>&rsquo; and then gouge you with service fees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared. &ldquo;What are you even talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this person doesn&rsquo;t put on this bracelet, the world will end! Also, that free admission scam is illegal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying about YOU being illegal, you free-admission lady!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, this conversation&rsquo;s getting nonsensical. What&rsquo;s this about admission fees &hellip; and the world ending?</p>
<p>&ldquo;More importantly, if you don&rsquo;t put this on, <em>twintails will disappear from the world!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;──────<strong>WHAT?</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I seized her by a shoulder, one fist held furiously to my chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gotcha.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Click</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;—ah,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because when she had surged forward into my grapple with mother-earth-Gaia-class tits to pin my fist down, her hidden hand had slipped the bracelet straight down my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank goodness. Now we&rsquo;re safe whenever they appear.&rdquo; Twirl nearly melted into my chest, looking at the wall clock with relief, then gazed up at me with moist eyes.</p>
<p>Oh no. She probably doesn&rsquo;t realize it, but pressed this close, her rack pushes against me with every movement &hellip; squishing, bouncing—this is bad.</p>
<p>But <em>don&rsquo;t lose</em>, Mitsuka Souji. You can&rsquo;t falter here! She&rsquo;s a foreign girl for whom this level of contact is &hellip; probably &hellip; normal..? If my impure thoughts show on my face, I&rsquo;ll ruin the image of Japanese men as paragons of integrity!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it off now! Throw it away!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I hesitated, Aika suddenly grabbed me by the scruff and yanked me away from Twirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Whoa!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, I felt weightless—lifting a grown teenage man into the air with one girl, this girl. I almost kicked the cups and plates off the table before I caught myself on the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get that—stupid, ghnnggh, huh??&rdquo; &ldquo;Ow, <em>Christ!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aika was turning pale trying to rip my wrist off with both hands as the bracelet refused to budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AAAUUUGH, it won&rsquo;t come <em>OFF&hellip;!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow, owowOW! It&rsquo;s like a wedding ring that&rsquo;s too tight?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plus, my arm&rsquo;s being held like with Twirl, but there&rsquo;s no cushioning. Just hurts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Wedding ring?!</em>&rdquo; For a moment, I thought I could see flames in her eyes. &ldquo;<em>GNAAAAAAAUUGGH!!</em>&rdquo; A foot suddenly slammed into my chest for leverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;GYAAAH, <em>STOP</em> YOU&rsquo;RE RIPPING MY <em>WHOLE HAND</em> OFF, NOT THE <em>BRACE!!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two more seconds of pure pain transpired before I suddenly dropped to the floor with a thump. Aika stared down from above me at the glimmering metal ring, no more defeated than an enraged bull—maybe an ounce more calculating.</p>
<p>Glimmering metal ring? I searched its edge. &ldquo;The hell? It fits my wrist perfectly &hellip; but there&rsquo;s no seams?&rdquo; No stretching, no rubber. Solid metal. But then how did she even get it onto my arm?!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if we twist your wrist like a screw, it&rsquo;ll come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; I wanted to cry. I turned my head over to the strange woman. &ldquo;Hey, sorry, but this, can you <em>take it off</em>—&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that very instant, we were enveloped in a <strong>vividly colored eye-searing flash of light</strong>.</p>
<p>And as that light weakened, dissolving into the air, the outlines of where our bodies had been grew thinner—and eventually, vanished completely.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;My apologies for the suddenness,&rdquo; Twirl&rsquo;s voice drifted in, &ldquo;but I thought this would be faster than explaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;—Huh? <em>Huh!?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the light faded, a different stimulus assaulted my eyes. That is, <em>smoke</em>, acrid enough to choke on. Half-panicking, I looked around.</p>
<p>Sunlight. Wind. Sidewalk, and asphalt. Sensations and feelings that hadn&rsquo;t been there moments ago flooded in all at once. My body couldn&rsquo;t keep up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;why are we suddenly outside?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no sleepwalker. To be thrown outdoors without knowing how—</p>
<p>Aika&rsquo;s voice, from above: &ldquo;And why are we <strong>HERE!?</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took time to recognize the place, even though it was fairly familiar. There was no way we should be here. I climbed to my feet in confusion.</p>
<p>Maxime Sorahate—the region&rsquo;s largest convention center. Two buildings, outdoor exhibition space. Events, concerts, school functions. We were in a corner of its outdoor parking lot. From my house, even by car, this would take at least 20 minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They came faster than expected &hellip; I meant to intercept them, but we&rsquo;re on the back foot.&rdquo; Twirl remained shockingly calm even as we freaked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have done this sooner&hellip;&rdquo; She looked at the pencil-sized stick in her hand, expression somber. Actually, the moment she held up that pen, we&rsquo;d been enveloped in the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you <em>DO</em> to us!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, I didn&rsquo;t <em>intend</em> to bring Aika-san along,&rdquo; a contempt bleeding through in her voice, &ldquo;but you <em>stubbornly wouldn&rsquo;t leave the effective radius</em>, so I had no choice~&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visibly rising fury on Aika&rsquo;s face was suddenly cut off by an ear-splitting roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;<em>now what!?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, hey! There&rsquo;s the source of that suffocating smoke. The cars, in the parking lot, exploding one-by-one like popcorn. Falling, and bursting into flames.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the café, I&rsquo;d worried about skit filming. But either this was <em>Hollywood</em>, or &hellip; and they don&rsquo;t hire actors without their knowing, right?</p>
<p>Just as I started towards the burning cars, Twirl&rsquo;s dainty fingers suddenly grabbed my shoulder. &ldquo;Souji-sama, please don&rsquo;t stray too far from me. They&rsquo;ll find you. The Imagine Chaff&rsquo;s effective range isn&rsquo;t that wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine &hellip; Chaff&hellip;?&rdquo; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you stay by my side, they won&rsquo;t find you. First, look at that monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as my eyes followed her other hand&rsquo;s slender finger, I beheld in the middle of the parking lot what I could only see at first as a shifting pillar of basalt and flesh.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off it. My gaze jerked briefly—very briefly—over to Aika, just as stunned, and then in unison we cried &ldquo;──────What the <em>HELL!?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha—no way, what <strong>IS</strong> that!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A head like a reptile, decorated with messy twisted horns. A soaring humanoid body clad in imposing metal armor. At first, given its bizarre appearance and the location, I thought <em>costume for an event?</em></p>
<p>But its weight cracked the asphalt with each step.</p>
<p><em>Thoom.</em></p>
<p>Over two meters tall. Vicious eyes that froze your body. Fangs that could shatter rocks. Countless blade-like dinosaur-like dorsal fins standing erect from back to tail. An undeniable reality. A presence from every cell, breathing with life, beheld with the terror of an ant facing down a spider.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be a costume. Had to be. Please.</p>
<p><em>Thoom.</em> Another car erupted in flames.</p>
<p>But looking from any angle—nothing but despair. Genuine—</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>A-a monster!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid scrapped cars, flames, smoke, the unknown monster strode about. It might be inappropriate to say it, but it was picturesque, like a scene cut from a movie made real.</p>
<p>Then, abruptly, it spoke in pure, clear Japanese: &ldquo;<em>Men, gather round!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did a double-take. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if swatting a bug, it sent a nearby car flying with one hand to punctuate the command, drowning out a chittering surge in the background that had begun with that call.</p>
<p>Aika and I could only watch speechlessly as the monster twisted its jaws into an unnatural smirk and shouted words colored by our shock—
<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Fwahahaha!! We shall claim every <em>single twintail in this world</em> for <em>ourselves</em>──────!!&rdquo;
<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;BWU<em>UUU</em>UU<em><strong>WHHAT??</strong></em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that insane proclamation bellowed in a gong-like voice, I almost vomited blood. Despite the distance, the voice carried like it was shouted right by my ear.</p>
<p>Aika picked her metaphorical jaw off the ground just to blurt out, &ldquo;Wait, Souji, why are you in a costume over there doing that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>That&rsquo;s not me!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The source of the chittering became clear as a swarming host of all-black figures appeared around the monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mokyeeeeee</em>──────!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A uniformly dressed, featureless <em>mob</em> of combat troops. Even their oddly shaped masks were solid black. They were like a horde of humanoid beetles, scattering with quick, insect-like steps.</p>
<p>And some had captured girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;twin &hellip; tails..?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart jumped. Not because I saw girls with twintails, but because the girls they were carrying matched <em>exactly</em> what the monster had shouted.</p>
<p>I turned to Aika to whisper. &ldquo;When he says &lsquo;claim&rsquo;&hellip; he means the twintailed girls?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>AIka whispered back. &ldquo;What are they planning?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twirl just silently watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, what a world lacking in twintails—<em>deplorable!</em> Covered in electricity and steel yet civilization appears stopped at the Stone Age!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly Japanese, but something was off. I mean, everything, yes, but.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no matter—that just means we can find <em>purer</em> twintails!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monster strode forward into the crowd of black goons &amp; battered girls, roiling with growling speech and angry shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men, don&rsquo;t forget the captain&rsquo;s words! The supreme Twintail Attribute was sensed in this area—search even if you must comb through the <em>grass!</em> &hellip;little girls crying while holding bunny plushies are merely a bonus!!&rdquo; <em>Wait, what?</em></p>
<p>A chitter of responses. &ldquo;&hellip;Moke?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mokyee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, goes without saying! Seizing the ultimate twintail Attribute is our long-cherished wish&hellip; but! Before being a warrior, I am also a man&hellip; so I too wish to see <em>little girls holding plushies!</em> Those who find them shall <em>receive praise!!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, okay. So it&rsquo;s not my imagination. They&rsquo;re just spouting nonsense in fluent Japanese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>We have no use for adults!</strong> Root them out quickly! A bit rough is fine!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black-clad figures started sorting through their captives with quick coordinated order. One finally raised a complaint to the lizard. &ldquo;Mokee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? There are no little girls holding plushies?! Hmm, if women won&rsquo;t hold plushies, <em>making</em> them hold them is a man&rsquo;s worth!! No matter, bring one here!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could these even be called <em>orders?</em> I felt like smashing something hard into them all just for being so <em>stupid.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Help meeee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sobbing young girl with disheveled twintails was brought before the monster. As she was looked down upon by that monstrous giant, she resembled a pitiful sacrificial shrine maiden.</p>
<p>I instantly tried to rush out. Aika grabbed my arm, stopping me, but my brain was finally catching up to this abnormal situation.</p>
<p>Wait. I reassessed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re kidnapping only twintailed girls—what are they <em>planning?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monsters weren&rsquo;t harming them. Rather, giving them dolls to pacify them..? I guess I can still hold back..?</p>
<p>I turned to the silver-haired girl. &ldquo;Hey, Twirl, you knew about this and brought us here, right? That monster is&hellip;&rdquo; But even as I spoke, my eyes caught a glimpse of something that never should have been there.</p>
<p>And yet, the radiance burned into my heart insistently confirmed it was no illusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;President.&rdquo;
<br>
<br>
<br>
No mistaking it. That demonic hairstyle that captivated me, that source of my suffering <em>from day one</em>.</p>
<p>Student Council President <em>Shindou Erina</em> in her school uniform was being forcibly dragged by two of the black goons, one gripping each arm. In the gymnasium, a team of maids had quietly followed her every move, but they were nowhere now. Aika followed my gaze and fell just as quiet.</p>
<p>Though it was hard to see clearly, the president was clutching something precious—half-sticking out of a shopping bag was a toy from a children&rsquo;s tokusatsu show. Hm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhand me!&rdquo; The president demanded with conviction the instant she came to a standstill.</p>
<p>The monster appraised her, staring intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohooooo. <em>Quite</em> the young child! And apparently a <em>young lady!!</em> Ojou-sama twintails&hellip; truly near-perfection!&rdquo; Those jaws and petrifying eyes surged forward to inspect the president. &ldquo;<em>Are you the ultimate twintail?!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ultimate&hellip;?! More importantly, who are you?! <em>You understand human language?!</em> Release the other girls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of <em>course</em> I understand. We&rsquo;re communicating thus, are we not? Therefore, I reject your demand for release.&rdquo; He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then answer me—what is the purpose of this charade?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand eventually! First, purely as a side matter─&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a familiar casualness, the monster held out a large stuffed cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>You shall hold this kitten plushie!</em> Even hostility shines as adorableness&hellip; a fair-skinned young girl <em>suits a kitten plushie well!!</em> Now, <strong>embrace it!!</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, three of the black-clad goons dropped a huge pink sofa onto the shattered asphalt. Several more seized the president, forced her to sit on the couch, and shoved the plushie into her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men, <em>burn this sight into your eyes!</em> Twintails, plushie, and the figure leaning against a sofa! This is the golden ratio I derived after years of training!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd erupted in shrill cries of &ldquo;Mokyeee!&rdquo; The outrageousness by itself, let alone the cacophony, made me dizzy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Despite my trembling legs, a surge of false bravado filled my chest. &ldquo;&hellip;anyway, I get that they&rsquo;re targeting twintailed girls &hellip; tell me, Twirl—<em>what should I do?</em> There&rsquo;s <em>something</em> I can do, that&rsquo;s why you <em>brought</em> me here, <em>right?!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twirl nodded in impressively calm agreement. &ldquo;Detailed explanations later. For now, let&rsquo;s act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aika and I both stared as she inhaled, clearly running through a detailed plan in her mind she had prepared well in advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Souji-sama &hellip; first, please undress me. Or rather, <em>rip my clothes off</em>. Oh right, like this,&rdquo; she grabbed my hand and yanked it up, &ldquo;pin <em>both</em> my arms above my head, and Souji-sama—with <em>one</em> hand—then with your other hand, tear off my bra—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the <strong>HELL</strong> are you <strong>BABBLING ABOUT?!</strong>&rdquo;</p>

        <p>I love twintails.</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I&rsquo;ve believed the world is beautiful because twintails exist. To me, the sun isn&rsquo;t that round thing shining in the sky—it&rsquo;s the hairstyle that fills my vision. Maybe it&rsquo;s an exaggeration to say twintails are my everything&hellip; actually, no, it&rsquo;s not an exaggeration at all. It&rsquo;s as simple as that: I love twintails more than anything else in this world.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Put simply, twintails are hair tied on both sides of the head. They look better with long hair, but even short hair gathered into little bunches is cute—it&rsquo;s a simple, feminine hairstyle. The variations are endless, filled with infinite possibilities. Even if you don&rsquo;t know the name, most people can picture it when you describe it.</p>
<p>But society at large tends to slap the &ldquo;childish&rdquo; label on twintails, and teenage girls desperate to appear mature cast aside anything that might make them look childish, one insecurity at a time. And unfortunately, twintails fall into that category; step by step, they get weeded out, eliminated through the process of growing up.</p>
<p>Anyways, once you&rsquo;re an adult, women who can pull off twintails are pretty rare anyway—and as for the guys? Well, it&rsquo;d be stupid to force that kind of request and piss off your partner. So &hellip; as you grow up, twintails become a distant thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine. That&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>But I was different.</p>
<p>The older I got, the stronger my obsession grew. In crowded places, I unconsciously <em>search</em> for twintails; it&rsquo;s like the image-editing software in my head just instantly throws a twintail layer on top of anyone I see. Since it&rsquo;s all unconscious, it doesn&rsquo;t bother me—but twintails occupy the majority of my life.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&hellip;Now, usually after hearing me go on and on about twintails this much, anyone who might&rsquo;ve wanted to be friends with me tends to remember they&rsquo;ve got somewhere to be and dashes for a quick exit. It&rsquo;s always been that way.</p>
<p>Still, I have no regrets—I don&rsquo;t feel self-conscious about it. A world where you can love what you love—that&rsquo;s the best kind, right? Changing or hiding your preferences just because people don&rsquo;t approve &hellip; that feels wrong, somehow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly why it&rsquo;s so frustrating.</p>
<p>No matter how much I love twintails, as a guy, I can never <em>become</em> a twintail. Even if I spent years growing my hair out and finally tied it up, that still wouldn&rsquo;t really be a twintail. All I have is a heart that loves them. Maybe I can never truly understand what it means to be one.</p>
<p>So I came to wish this feeling could take form. I wished this heart would <em>take shape</em> and <em>appear</em> before my eyes. That it might surely become the perfect twintail I&rsquo;ve always imagined.</p>
<p>How wonderful that would be.</p>
<p>Always, always, I dreamed of it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Until that day—<em>the day I met her</em>────────</p>

<p>This is a fan translation project of the Japanese light novel series <strong>Ore, Twintail Ni Narimasu</strong> (俺、ツインテールになります。) by Yume Mizusawa, also known as <strong>Gonna Be a Twintail!!</strong> in English.</p>
<h2 id="ancient-history">Ancient History</h2>
<p>A long time ago, a crazed tripfag by the name of Woodsrunner on /a/ made a valiant effort to translate the remaining untranslated titles in the <em>Ore, Twintail Ni Narimasu</em> series. But just as the Baka-Tsuki needed him most, he vanished.</p>
<p>As his websites at woods-runner.info (&amp; Ultimaguil Base before it) have since fallen &amp; taken his notes with him, I felt it was time that someone put together another reinvigorated effort to bring this awful piece of trash to English, the world&rsquo;s worst language, where it belongs.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m kidding. I seriously love <del>twintails</del> these books &amp; I&rsquo;d sooner have more anons who could appreciate them.</p>

<h2 id="translation-style">Translation Style</h2>
<p>This is not a 1:1 literal translation. Anyone who&rsquo;s learned to speak a second language, especially one that&rsquo;s substantially divorced from their native tongue, will quickly learn that translation is an art &amp; not a science.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve paid great care to Yume&rsquo;s tone &amp; intentions, the vast majority of the resulting text has been edited in grammatical structure &amp; content to flow smoothly in English. It is my <em>unprofessional opinion</em> that the content of these edits do not meaningfully deviate from the original work, but it is possible that others may have different interpretations of the root text.</p>
<p>Some wordplay &amp; puns that are untranslatable or incoherent to American audiences, or that rely on obscure Japanese cultural traditions or patterns, have been replaced with similar equivalents native to English speakers.</p>
<p>In all cases, I have worked to avoid censorship.</p>
<h3 id="translation-choices">Translation Choices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I know Twirl&rsquo;s &ldquo;proper&rdquo; romanized name going by her character sheet is <em>T[&hellip;]earle</em> (most likely <em>Twoearle</em>) but I feel strongly that Twirl reads better than Twoearle &amp; I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a meaningful point of contention when there&rsquo;s no official English translation available.</li>
<li>While the Guildies&rsquo; katakana names are deliberately mangled from the original English words that inspired them, I have instead chosen to keep their names as 1:1 matched to their inspirational animals on the basis that the mangled forms are distracting &amp; unnecessary.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve left in a series of otaku-specific terms that should be familiar to American fans of Japanese media, most particularly where these terms have no clear equivalent or translation into English (i.e. &ldquo;ojou-sama&rdquo; in the context of the character archetype).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="translation-credits">Translation Credits</h2>
<p>Much of the bulk work has been performed with Claude, with chapters proof-read &amp; extensively edited by myself for literary flow &amp; error-correction against the original 日本語 in a convoluted process of double-checking far too many iterations of the same fucking chapter across two different languages.</p>
